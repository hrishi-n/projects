# Projects
This repo is going to include the new Front-End and Back-End projects that I am going to work on to practice for new interviews. 

This is going to include the following tech stack:
1. Angular & React
2. Java & Python
3. Oracle SQL & MySQL
4. AWS (Very important to complete the certification by early November. )

As part of this, I am going to work on few more things. For example,

1. I am also going to start working on leetcode anew. 
2. There are some more technical things that I feel I should be well-versed in which are:
   1. Vim
   2. MarkUp Documentation
3. Write a journal in git in markup style just so that I can work on 2 things at once.
