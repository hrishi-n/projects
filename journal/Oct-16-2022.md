# Highlights
Today I started working on what I want to do with my career. Not exactly what I want to do but to support the lifestyle I want, computers is a good choice for me. 

I am going to work on 3 things everyday in my life. 
1. Any type of activity per day
2. Eating healthy
3. Practicing my projects and techstack everyday.

Lets see where this takes me in a week.
